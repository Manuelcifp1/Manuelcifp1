### Greetings earthlings!! 👋

My name is Manolo Alba and I am what people usually call “an old dog learning new tricks”

I was born in 1966 and started my studies of web applications development in September 2022 at CIFP1 of Ceuta, Spain.

Those last five months have been a crazy rollercoaster of stress, emotions, lack of sleep and tons of new knowledge getting stuffed in my head like in that scene of “Matrix” when Neo was learning kung-fu plugged to a computer.

But you know what? I loved every minute of it!! 😍😍😍

Going back to a classroom when you are older is an amazing experience that makes you feel younger. 

It´s so great to have the opportunity of interacting with younger people (in both sides, classmates and teachers 😁), to realize that your brain still works (moreless 😂)  and you are capable of learning side by side with guys 30 years younger than you.

Resuming, it´s an experience I recommend to everyone and if you have the opportunity of doing something similar, do not hesitate and take it. You will not regret it.

On the other side, I have some other pastimes (or used to have, actually 😅) Sea kayaking and cosplay were 2 of them:

But all of these would have not been possible without the support of my family=my wonderful wife + my amazing kid 😍😍, lots of kisses for them 😘😘😘😘

And that would be all for the moment, but the future looks bright!!!
